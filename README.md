## ‚ú® Recent Updates (August 2025)

### Monorepo Architecture
We've successfully migrated from separate repositories to a unified monorepo structure, making development and contribution significantly easier:
- **Single repository** for both the library (`fossflow-lib`) and application (`fossflow-app`)
- **NPM Workspaces** for streamlined dependency management
- **Instant library updates** available in the app during development
- **Unified build process** with `npm run build` at the root

### üê≥ Docker & Deployment Improvements
- **Multi-architecture Docker support** - Images now support both `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64`
- **Docker Hub integration** - Pre-built images available at `stnsmith/fossflow:latest`
- **Simple deployment** - Just run `docker compose up` to deploy
- **Production-ready** - Nginx-based serving with optimized builds

```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## Monorepo Structure

This is a monorepo containing two packages:

- `packages/fossflow-lib` - React component library for drawing network diagrams (built with Webpack)
- `packages/fossflow-app` - Progressive Web App for creating isometric diagrams (built with RSBuild)

### Development Commands

```bash
# Development
npm run dev          # Start app development server
npm run dev:lib      # Watch mode for library development

# Building
npm run build        # Build both library and app
npm run build:lib    # Build library only
npm run build:app    # Build app only

# Testing & Linting
npm test             # Run tests
npm run lint         # Check for linting errors

# Publishing
npm run publish:lib  # Publish library to npm
```

## How to Use
